The interface includes a search engine focused to locate only gas stations from a 12-mile perimeter based on its location ignoring other retail locations or shops. <br><br> Also the interface allows to show more details from the list view for each gastion showing different gas type prices, address of vicinity, phone number, rating, and logo. As the user chooses a gas station, the Map View allows to get directions from their position to their destination with Google's Map turn-by-turn directions.</p>

                  During our development we had some limitations such as finding accurate information about gas prices as we had to web scrape data from Gas Buddy website, and there was not given any API or database to plugin into our application. Still our application accomplishes about goal to provide information to drivers about gas price, distance, ETA, services, amenities, gas types, driving directions all based on their location.</p>
